# SafeGuardLLM

## Overview
SafeGuardLLM is a comprehensive cybersecurity evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) with integrated Regional GuardRails for multi-regional content validation. It provides advanced testing capabilities to assess LLM vulnerabilities across multiple security dimensions, including prompt injection, jailbreaking, code interpreter abuse, and data extraction attacks. The application is a full-stack web application designed for real-time evaluation with a professional, security-focused UI. Its vision is to provide a robust solution for ensuring the security and ethical behavior of LLMs in diverse operational environments.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture
### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **LLM Providers**: Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini)
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication for evaluation progress tracking

### Database Design
- **Entities**: Users, LLM Models, Test Suites, Test Cases, Evaluations, Evaluation Results.

### Key Components
- **Model Management System**: Supports multi-provider LLM integration (OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) with configurable parameters and long-term memory integration.
- **Test Suite Framework**: Includes comprehensive tests for Prompt Injection (standard and multilingual), Jailbreaking, Code Interpreter abuse, Data Extraction, MITRE ATT&CK Framework, Memory Corruption & Exploitation, Spear Phishing & Social Engineering, and Code Interpreter Exploitation.
- **Evaluation Engine**: Provides asynchronous evaluation processing with real-time WebSocket updates, configurable test parameters, and batch evaluation capabilities.
- **Security Assessment Components**: Features vulnerability scoring with multiple severity levels, impact assessment, detection difficulty, remediation complexity, and confidence scoring.
- **Dashboard and Visualization**: Offers real-time security metrics, interactive progress tracking, and a professional cybersecurity-themed UI with filtering capabilities.

### Data Flow
User initiates evaluation, engine processes tests with LLM, WebSockets provide live updates, evaluators analyze responses, results are persisted to PostgreSQL, and the dashboard visualizes metrics.

### Deployment Strategy
- **Primary Runtime**: Node.js 20 with Express server.
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend, ESBuild for backend.
- **Environment**: Replit configured with runtime error overlay.
- **Python Support**: Minimal Python 3.11 for Regional GuardRails validation scripts.
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for production and development, Nginx for reverse proxy.
